                            Third-party ad servers or ad networks use technologies like cookies, JavaScript or Web
                            Beacons

                            These
                            technologies are used to measure the effectiveness of their advertising campaigns and/or to
                            personalize
                            the advertising content that you see on websites that you visit.

                            Note that Specialized Nepal has no access to or control over these cookies that are used by
